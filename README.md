## Features

Oruga is a lightweight UI components library for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) without any dependency.
It offers a set of easily customisable components and doesn't depend on any specific style or CSS framework (like Bootstrap, Bulma, TailwindCSS, etc...). Therefore, it doesn't provide a grid system or CSS utilities, but you can integrate any CSS framework you like.
Oruga provides you with a set of functional components, so you can focus only on the UI/UX aspects of your application and can be entirely flexible for future changes without having to touch a line of JavaScript.

* **CSS framework agnostic**: No dependency on a specific CSS framework/library but you can easily integrate the components with one of them because they are fully customizable in different ways
* **Components with steroids**: most of the components aren't a simple wrapper of native elements but they add new and custom features
* **Lightweight**: no other internal dependency and import only components that you need

If you need a component library and want to easily apply your custom styles, Oruga is the library for you! üêõ

In addition, if you don't want to style everything yourself, we've created several [themes](https://oruga-ui.com/documentation/themes.html) to provide you with a variety of ready-to-use styles. ü¶ã

## Documentation

Browse [online documentation here](https://oruga-ui.com/documentation/).

üíÖ For more info about components customization, [read carefully the "customization" section](https://oruga-ui.com/documentation/customisation.html) in the documentation.

üïπ To see Oruga in action, go to the [Example section](https://oruga-ui.com/documentation/#examples) in the documentation.

Note: the documentation source code is in the `docs` directory, it serves as the demo as well.

## Quick start

üêõ Oruga is available for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) **version 3.x** 

### Setup Oruga

1. Install Oruga.

```bash
npm install @oruga-ui/oruga-next
```

2. Import the components:

- To get started quickly, use `Oruga` to register all components:

    ```js
    import { createApp } from 'vue'
    import Oruga from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';
    
    createApp(...).use(Oruga);
    ```

 - To use tree shaking, either register component manually:

    ```js
    import { createApp } from 'vue'
    import { OField, OInput } from '@oruga-ui/oruga'
    
    createApp(...)
      .use(OField)
      .use(OInput)
    ```
    
 - or [import them in your SFC](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/registration.html#local-registration).

### Customization

Oruga's superpower is its configurability and its CSS framework agnostic approach.
Each component can be individually customised and configured by defining specific classes using a class-mapping approach. Therefore, Oruga comes without any styling by default. However, there are several official predefined configurations called themes, which you can include and extend to give your application a individual look and feel. And all components came with predefined classes by default.

Please [read the "customization" section](https://oruga-ui.com/documentation/customisation.html) in Oruga documentation.

If you want to see an example with a fully customized registration form using `Tailwind`, `Bulma`, `Bootstrap` or `Material` CSS framework have a look at the official [Oruga multiframework example](https://oruga-multiframework-demo.netlify.app/tailwind) (source code available [here](https://github.com/oruga-ui/demo-multiframework)) or if you're more familiar with TailwindCSS 2 give our official [TailwindCSS Demo](https://oruga-tailwindcss-demo.netlify.app/) a try (source code [here](https://github.com/oruga-ui/demo-tailwindcss))

### Using Oruga with Nuxt

Oruga doesn't provide a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) module at the moment.

You can use Nuxt.js plugins system adding a file (e.g. `oruga.js`) in your `plugins` folder containing:

```js
import Oruga from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(Oruga);
});
```

To make this plugin available in your app, add this file to the `plugins` array in your `nuxt.config.js`

```js
plugins: [{ src: '~plugins/oruga.js' }]
```

To understand how the plugins work with Nuxt.js, take a look at the [NuxtJS plugin documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guides/configuration-glossary/configuration-plugins).

Take a look at the [official NuxtJS + Oruga example](https://github.com/oruga-ui/demo-nuxtjs).
