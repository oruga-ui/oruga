# Introduction

Oruga is a lightweight UI component library for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) **without any dependency** and doesn't depend on any specific style or CSS framework (such as Bootstrap, Bulma, Tailwind, etc).
Therefore, it **doesn't provide a grid system or CSS utilities**; however, you can easily integrate any CSS framework you like (see the [demo](#examples)). 

Oruga provides you with a set of functional and easily customisable components, where you can define classes globally and override them locally when necessary. So you can **focus only on the UI/UX aspects** of your application
and can be entirely flexible for future changes without having to touch a line of JavaScript. 

If you need a component library and want to easily apply your [custom styles](/documentation/configuration), Oruga is the library for you! üêõ  
In addition, if you don't want to style everything yourself, we've created several [themes](/documentation/themes) to provide you with a variety of ready-to-use styles. ü¶ã

---

üêõ Oruga is available for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) **version 3.x**.

üíÖ For more information about customising components, go to [configuration](/documentation/configuration).

ü¶ã For a list of all available custom styles, go to [themes](/documentation/themes).

üïπ To see Oruga in action, go to [examples](#examples).


::: warning _Oruga for Vue 2.x deprecated_  
Due to [EOL for Vue 2.x](https://v2.vuejs.org/lts/) at the end of the year 2023, from now on Oruga for Vue 2 ([`@oruga-ui/oruga`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oruga-ui/oruga)) is deprecated. 
Further enhancements will only be developed for [`@oruga-ui/oruga-next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oruga-ui/oruga-next).
:::


## Setup

Install Oruga with your favorite package manager:

::: code-group

```bash [Npm]
npm install @oruga-ui/oruga-next
```

```bash [Yarn]
yarn add @oruga-ui/oruga-next
```

```html [Cdn]
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@oruga-ui/oruga-next/dist/oruga.js"></script>
```

:::


### Oruga Plugin

To import all Oruga components you can use the default `Oruga` export in your main entry point.
To specify some global configuration, a configuration object can be passed as second argument of `app.use` when installing it.  
See [configuration](/documentation/configuration) for details of the available configuration options.

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import Oruga from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(Oruga, {
  // here goes the global config
});
```

After the installation, you can use all the components in an [SFC](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc) like this:

```html
<template>
  <o-button>oruga-ui</o-button>
</template>
```


### Individual Components (tree shaking)

To take advantage of bundler‚Äôs [tree-shaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking) optimizations, each component can also be added individually using its own plugin. Doing so allows you to globally add only the components you need, including their sub- and programmatic components:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import { Autocomplete, Sidebar } from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';

createApp(...)
  .use(Autocomplete)
  .use(Sidebar);
```

When only using individual components, no global configuration is initialised by default.
To add some global configuration we provide an additional `OrugaConfig` plugin:

```js
import { OrugaConfig } from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';

const options: OrugaOptions = { ... }

createApp(...)
  .use(OrugaConfig, options);
```

However, if you just need to import a single component separately, without any additional programmatic functionalities, you can import individual components like this:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import { OAutocomplete, OSidebar } from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';

createApp(...)
  .component(OAutocomplete)
  .component(OSidebar);
```


### Styling

Oruga comes without any styling by default, but you can easily add your own custom styles or an additional theme package.
For more details and a list of available themes, see [configuration](/documentation/configuration) and [themes](/documentation/themes).

The default **Oruga theme** can be added like this:

::: code-group

```bash [Npm]
npm install @oruga-ui/theme-oruga
```

```bash [Yarn]
yarn add @oruga-ui/theme-oruga
```

```html [Cdn]
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@oruga-ui/theme-oruga/dist/oruga.min.css" />
```
:::

```scss
@import '@oruga-ui/theme-oruga/dist/scss/oruga.scss';
```


### Volar support
If you are using Volar, you can specify global component types by configuring `compilerOptions.types` in `tsconfig.json`.

```js
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "types": ["@oruga-ui/oruga-next/volar"]
  }
}
```


### Nuxt module

Oruga doesn't provide a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) module at the moment.

But you can use Nuxt.js plugins system adding a file (e.g. `oruga.js`) in your `plugins` folder containing:

```js
import Oruga from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(Oruga);
});
```

To make this plugin available in your app, add this file to the `plugins` array in your `nuxt.config.js`:

```js
plugins: [{ src: '~plugins/oruga.js' }]
```

To understand how the plugins work with Nuxt.js, take a look at the [NuxtJS plugin documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/plugins/).
