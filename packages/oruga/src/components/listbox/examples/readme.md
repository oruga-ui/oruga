The **Listbox** component presents a list of options and allows a user to select one or more of them.
The component uses the [ARIA listbox role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/listbox_role) and implements the W3C ARIA APG [Listbox Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/).
Combine it with the [Field](/components/Field) component to access all functionalities.
