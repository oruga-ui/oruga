The **Carousel** component is a slideshow for cycling through a set of elements — images or text like - a carousel, referred to as slides, by sequentially displaying a subset of one or more slides.
One slide is displayed at a time, and users can activate a next or previous slide control that hides the current slide and "rotates" the next or previous slide into view.
The component implements the W3C ARIA APG [Carousel Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/).
