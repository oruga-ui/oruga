The **Radio** input component uses [HTML's native radio inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) to allow a user to select one value from a set of options. 
The component supports the W3C ARIA APG [Radio Group Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/).
Use it with the [Field](/components/field.html) component to access all the functionalities.
