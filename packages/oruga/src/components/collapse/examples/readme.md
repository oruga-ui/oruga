The **Collapse** component is an easy way to toggle the visibility of content with show/hide functionality.
It has two elements: a disclosure button and a section of content whose visibility is controlled by the button. 
The component implements the W3C ARIA APG [Disclosure (Show/Hide) Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/) and also supports the W3C ARIA APG [Accordion Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/).
