The **Taginput** input component allows users to search through a list of options and apply any number of tags. 
The component is based on the [Autocomplete](/components/autocomplete.html) component and supports the W3C ARIA APG [Combobox Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/).
Use it with the [Field](/components/field.html) component to access all the functionalities.
