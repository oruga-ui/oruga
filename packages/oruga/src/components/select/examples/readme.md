The **Select** input component uses [HTML's native select input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select).
Select inputs can be single value selections, or multi-value selections by using the `multiple` attribute. 
Use it with the Field component to access all the functionalities.
