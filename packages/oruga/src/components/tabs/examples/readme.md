The **Tabs** component is a responsive horizontal navigation bar that allows the user to easily switch between content.
*Tab panels*are a set of individual content sections, where only one content panel can be displayed at a time.
Each tab panel has an associated tab element that, when activated, displays the panel. The list of tab elements is arranged along one edge of the currently displayed panel, the top edge. 
The component implements the W3C ARIA APG [Tabs Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/).
