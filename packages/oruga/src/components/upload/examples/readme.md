The **Upload** input component uses [HTML's native file input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file). It allows users to select files from their device for upload. In addition to native input features, it adds support for Drag and drop and clearing the input.
Use it with the [Field](/components/Field) component to access all the functionalities.
