The **Switch** input component — sometimes called a "toggle" — offers a choice between one of two values; 
it's a great option when you want the user to toggle a feature on or off.
This component implements the W3C ARIA APG [Switch Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/switch/).
Use it with the Field component to access all the functionalities.
