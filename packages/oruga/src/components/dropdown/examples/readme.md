The **Dropdown** component is very versatile and can be used as contextual overlays for displaying lists as a quick menu or even toggleable to allow users to select a value from a list of content options.
Unlike native select elements, the dropdown input allows you to customize both its appearance and behavior.
The component implements the W3C ARIA APG [Combobox Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/).
