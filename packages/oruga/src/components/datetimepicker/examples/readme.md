The **datetimepicker** input component uses [HTML's native date picker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date) to allow users to select a date and time from a customizable calendar, and type the date directly into the input with full internationalization support.
The input opens a simple dropdown/modal for selecting a date, and uses the native datetimepicker for mobile.
The component is based on the Datepicker component.
