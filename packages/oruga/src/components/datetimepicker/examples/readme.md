The **Datetimepicker** input component allow users to select a date and time based on their browser’s locale from a customizable calendar, and type the date directly into the input with full internationalization support.
The input opens a simple dropdown/modal for selecting a date, and uses the native datetimepicker for mobile.
The component is based on the [Datepicker](/components/datepicker.html) component.
