The **Tree** component presents a hierarchical list. Any item in the hierarchy may have child items, and items that have children may be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the children. Items with children can be cexpanded or collapsed and child items can be selected.
The component implements the W3C ARIA APG [Tree View Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/).
