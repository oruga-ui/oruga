The **Tree** component presents a hierarchical list of items. Any item in the hierarchy can have children. Items with children may be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the children.
The component uses the [ARIA tree role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tree_role) and implements the W3C ARIA APG [Tree View Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/).
Combine it with the [Field](/components/Field) component to access all functionalities.
