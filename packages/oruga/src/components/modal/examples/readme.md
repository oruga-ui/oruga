The **Modal** component is a classic modal overlay in which you can include any content you like.
The content under the overlay is inert, meaning users cannot interact with content outside the active modal window.
By default, modal overlays contain their own tab sequence so that users cannot navigate outside the component.
The component supports the W3C ARIA APG [Dialog (Modal) Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/) as well as the W3C ARIA APG [Alert and Message Dialogs Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alertdialog/).
