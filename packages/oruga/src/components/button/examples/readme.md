The **Button** component uses [HTML's native button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) by default.
The `label` prop is used to populate the text of the button — or alternatively you can use the default slot.
The button can be have different colors, sizes, and states.
The component supports the W3C ARIA APG [Button Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/button/).
