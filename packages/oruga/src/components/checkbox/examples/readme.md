The **Checkbox** input component uses [HTML's native checkbox input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox). 
It can display one or many options to a user and is a great way to allow users to select multiple items from a list.
The component supports single and multiple checkbox inputs.
The component supports the W3C ARIA APG [Checkbox  Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/checkbox/).
Use it with the Field component to access all the functionalities.
