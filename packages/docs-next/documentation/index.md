# Introduction

Oruga is a <b>lightweight UI components library</b> for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)<b> without any dependency.</b><br>
It offers a <b>set of easily customisable components </b> and <b>doesn't depend on any specific style or CSS framework</b> (like Bootstrap, Bulma, TailwindCSS, etc).
Therefore, it <b>doesn't provide a grid system or CSS utilities</b>, but you can <b>integrate any CSS framework</b> you like (see the [demo](#examples)).<br>
Oruga provides you with a set of functional components, so you can <b>focus only on the UI/UX aspects</b> of your application
and can be entirely flexible for future changes without having to touch a line of JavaScript.


If you need a component library and want to easily apply your [custom styles](/documentation/customisation), Oruga is the library for you! üêõ

In addition, if you don't want to style everything yourself, we've created several [themes](/documentation/themes) to provide you with a variety of ready-to-use styles. ü¶ã

## Setup

::: code-group

```bash [Npm]
npm install @oruga-ui/oruga-next
```

```bash [Yarn]
yarn add @oruga-ui/oruga-next
```

```html [Cdn]
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@oruga-ui/oruga-next/dist/oruga.js"></script>
```

:::

::: warning _Oruga for Vue 2.x deprecated_  
Due to [EOL for Vue 2.x](https://v2.vuejs.org/lts/) at the end of the year 2023, from now on Oruga for Vue 2 ([`@oruga-ui/oruga`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oruga-ui/oruga)) is deprecated. 
Further enhancements will only be developed for [`@oruga-ui/oruga-next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oruga-ui/oruga-next).
:::


### Full bundle import

You can import all Oruga components using the main plugin export:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import Oruga from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';

createApp(...).use(Oruga);
```

After the installation, you can use all the components in your SFC like this.

```html
<template>
  <o-button>oruga-ui</o-button>
</template>
```

### Individual components imports (tree shaking)

Each component can also be added individually using its own plugin. This adds the component, including its subcomponents and programmatic components:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import { Autocomplete, Sidebar } from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';

createApp(...)
  .use(Autocomplete)
  .use(Sidebar);
```

However, if you just need to import a single component separately, without any additional programmatic functionalities, you can import individual components like this:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import { OAutocomplete, OSidebar } from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';

createApp(...)
  .component(OAutocomplete)
  .component(OSidebar);
```


### Styling

Oruga comes without any styling by default, but you can easily add your own custom styles or an additional theme package.
For more details and a list of available themes, see [#customisation](/documentation/customisation) and [#themes](/documentation/themes).

The default **Oruga theme** can be added like this:

::: code-group

```bash [Npm]
npm install @oruga-ui/theme-oruga
```

```bash [Yarn]
yarn add @oruga-ui/theme-oruga
```

```html [Cdn]
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@oruga-ui/theme-oruga/dist/oruga.min.css" />
```
:::

```scss
@import '@oruga-ui/theme-oruga/dist/scss/oruga-full.scss';
```

### Volar support
If you are using Volar, you can specify global component types by configuring `compilerOptions.types` in `tsconfig.json`.

```js
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "types": ["@oruga-ui/oruga-next/volar"]
  }
}
```


## Nuxt module

Oruga doesn't provide a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) module at the moment.

You can use Nuxt.js plugins system adding a file (e.g. `oruga.js`) in your `plugins` folder containing:

```js
import Oruga from '@oruga-ui/oruga-next';

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(Oruga);
});
```

To make this plugin available in your app, add this file to the `plugins` array in your `nuxt.config.js`:

```js
plugins: [{ src: '~plugins/oruga.js' }]
```

To understand how the plugins work with Nuxt.js, take a look at the [NuxtJS plugin documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/plugins/).
