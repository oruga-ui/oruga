# Raising an Issue

* Make sure the issue hasn't been raised yet
* Include **screenshots** or animated GIFs in your issue whenever needed (if visual issue)

# Submitting a Pull Request

* The ``master`` branch is a snapshot of the latest release. **Submit your PR in the ``dev`` branch**
* Include **screenshots** or animated GIFs in your pull request whenever needed (if visual changes)
* It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging
* **DO NOT** commit the ``lib`` and ``dist`` folder, use it only for testing on your end
* If adding new feature:
    * Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it

## Principles

### 1. Desktop and Mobile support

It has to work, **and** have great UX on both platforms.

### 2. Lightweight and simple

* Keep it simple.
* Performance is UX, keep it lightweight.
* Avoid HTML-only components, if it doesn't need JavaScript, then it doesn't need Vue (with a few exceptions).

### 3. Transitions / Animations GPU-based only

The only properties that uses hardware acceleration are:

* transform
* opacity
* filter

These are two great articles about it: https://medium.com/outsystems-experts/how-to-achieve-60-fps-animations-with-css3-db7b98610108 and https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-hardware-acceleration-css-animations/.

And here is one about the FLIP technique (which ``<transition-group>`` uses internally): https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/.
